							<h3>My role</h3>
							<p>UI/UX</p>
							<h3>Worked on</h3>
							<p>Desk research: Finding out from which angle we want to tackle our problem by asking ourselves the question: Do we want to better the gaming behaviour of children so that their sleeping quality will be improved? I also have done
								research about how people sleep and what kind of REM phases there are.
							</p>
							<p>User research: Finding out how we can positively impact the behaviour of our target audience and implementing it in a way that attracts the user.</p>
							<p>Ideation and Concepting: Showing our idea to the client and then reiterating based on the feedback.</p>
							<p>Testing: Testing our concept to see if it was working as intended.</p>

						</div>

						<div>
							<h3>Type of product</h3>
							<p>Physical product</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div className={styles.contentWrapper}>
						<div>
							<h3>The problem</h3>
							<p>Young children have a lot of free time. They can choose to play outside
							but also can game whenever they want. They often spend multiple hours gaming in a row.
							These long sessions of gaming could make them end up being game addicts. Gaming too much could
							lead to sleep deprivation.
								</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3>Design Challenge</h3>
							<p>Design a product that positively stimulates the gaming behaviour of children between
							six and twelve years old. It was quite a challenge to design the UX of this project. This was
							also my first time designing a physical product so there was a lot to learn.
								</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div className={styles.contentWrapper}>

						<div>
							<h3>The solution</h3>
							<p>The Game Changer is a timer that is specifically designed for children between six and twelve years old. It keeps track of the
							playtime of your child. You simply enter how long the child can game and the timer starts running.
							If he decides to stop earlier than planned, The Game Changer will give him a reward in the form of
							extra time. This 'bonus' time can only be used if their parents allow it.
					</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div className={styles.contentWrapper}>
						<div>
							<h3>Setting up the chicken</h3>
							<p>
								When the chicken is powered on, you will start with setting up the security settings.
								This will be done by registering your fingerprint. After having set up the system you are
								able to choose between the gametimer or setting up a bonusday.
						</p>

					</div>

					<div className={styles.contentWrapper}>
						<div>
							<h3>The chicken has feelings!</h3>
							<p>
								You stop the gametimer by pressing its mohawk. The Game Changer will become happy if you stop 1 hour before the timer ends.
								You will get that one hour plus half an hour extra that you can use for a bonusdays. When you stop half an hour between an
								hour the chicken will look concerned. When the chicken is concerned you will get 15 minutes bonus. If you stop half an hour or later the chicken will be sad and you wonâ€™t get any bonushours. The numbers at the right side are the hours that have been saved up.

					</div>

					<div className={styles.contentWrapper}>
						<img className={styles.imageSize} src={beakRotation} alt="" />
						<div>
							<h3>Adjust the timer</h3>
							<p>
								You can rotate the beak to adjust the gametimer. When you want to change the selection of hours
								and minutes, you can click once on the beak. When you are done setting up the timer, double tap
								the beak to start.
						</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div className={styles.contentWrapper}>
						<img className={styles.imageSize} src={chickenBonus} alt="" />
						<div>
							<h3>Bonusday</h3>
							<p>
								When your child has been very nice or if the holidays have started, you might consider starting a bonusday. By initiating a bonusday The Game Changer will use the spare hours that have been stored. You can start a bonusday via the main menu. The timer starts immediately.
								When the child is done, he can press on the mohawk to end the bonusday.
